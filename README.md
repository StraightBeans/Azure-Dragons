Once you're inside your IDE, open up a terminal and run the following after changing the path:

git clone https://github.com/StraightBeans/Azure-Dragons /path/to/where/you/want/it/saved
```
Now open up your IDE from where you saved our repository and you're ready to go

## Uploading Changes with Git
Run the following after changing the username and email:
